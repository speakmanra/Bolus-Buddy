# Bolus Buddy

## A React Native mobile app that calulates the amount of insulin you should give yourself depending on the carbohydrates that you eat and your current bloodsugar. Used for people with type one diabetes.

### Must be run using the expo app on iphone for the time being. The ios app store restricts me from uploading this without being tied to an insulin manufacturing company.
